**Rotate matrix:**

O(n^2) time and O(1) space algorithm ( without any workarounds and hanky-panky stuff! )

**Rotate by +90:**

Step1: Transpose

Step2: Reverse each row

**Rotate by -90:**

Step1: Transpose

Step2: Reverse each column

**Rotate by +180:**

Method 1: Rotate by +90 twice

Method 2: Reverse each row and then reverse each column

**Rotate by -180:**

Method 1: Rotate by -90 twice

Method 2: Reverse each column and then reverse each row

Method 3: Reverse by +180 as they are same
