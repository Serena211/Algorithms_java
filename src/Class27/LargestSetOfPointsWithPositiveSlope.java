 * Given an array of 2D coordinates of points (all the coordinates are integers),

 * 
 * Assumptions
 * The given array is not null and is not empty
 * 
 * Note: if there does not even exist 2 points can form a line with positive slope, 
 * should return 0.
 * 
 * Examples
 * <0, 0>, <1, 1>, <2, 3>, <3, 3>, the maximum set of points are {<0, 0>, <1, 1>, <2, 3>}, 
 * the size is 3.
